## The project:

Hi People! ðŸ‘‹
Let me show you my Single Page Application.
It's done with Javascript, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, Node JS, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL.

## Some of the things I've learned building this App:

## Front End:

- Built with reusable and CSS styled React components..

- Improve and make more efficient the data flow with Redux when needed for bigger projects.

- Modularization of a project.

- Fetch/axios requests.

- Manage the browser URL with React Routing.

## Back End:

- Build our backend from the start.

- Create our own URLs as needed.

- Request data to external APIs or databases of our own.

- Manage different kind of HTTP methods with Node.Js and Express.

## Database:

- Create our own database with SQL and PostgreSQL and learn how to manage the data.

## Main functions:

The website includes some functionalities like create new videogames, search games by name, alphabetic and rating order and filter by game genre or source (API / DB / Both).

The data is extracted from the RAWG videogames API (https://rawg.io/apidocs)

## To execute the app in your computer browser:

First clone the repository in your PC.

Open a git-bash terminal in both "client" and "api" folders, and type "npm install" . 

Finally, type "npm start" on both termials and wait for the browser to open the website.

Hope you like it!
